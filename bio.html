<h1>Short bio</h1>
</div>
<p>From September 2023 to June 2024, I was a Research Assistant Professor at <a href="https://www.ttic.edu">Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://nati.ttic.edu">Nathan Srebro</a>. <br />
From 2017 to 2023, I was a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Stanford University, where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/">Prof. Andrea Montanari</a>. My thesis focused on the theory of Deep Learning and was awarded the Theodore W. Anderson Theory of Statistics Award. A copy can be found <a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/14782661">here</a>. During my PhD, I visited <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JEeMxH0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Emmanuel Abbe</a> at EPFL and spent a semester at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, UC Berkeley. <br />
Before my PhD, I was a student at Ecole Normale Superieure de Paris from 2013 to 2017, where I received a B.Sc. in Mathematics and a M.Sc. in Theoretical Physics. During my time there, I worked on various projects, including inverse Ising problems, LDPC codes, <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms">CMS experiment at LHC</a>, <a href="https://www.dwavesys.com">D-Wave 2X</a>, and massive gravity. <br />
